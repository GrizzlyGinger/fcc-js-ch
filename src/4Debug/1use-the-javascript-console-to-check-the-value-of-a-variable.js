//console.log() prints the output of whatever is in the paretheses to the console
//  DevTools includes JS consoles in Chrome and Firefox
//Placing console.log() at strategic points in code can show intermediate variable values
//  like tasting food as you cook
//  Good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at it
//Having test points helps narrow down problem scopes

let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this line
console.log(a);

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);
