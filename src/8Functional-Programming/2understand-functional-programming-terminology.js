//Client 'mood swings' are pretty common, requiring a function to be revisited to handle various requests and make it more flexible
//Callbacks are functions that are slipped or passed to another function to determine the invocation of that function
//First Class Functions are functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function like any other normal value
//Higher Order Functions are functions that take a function as an argument or return a function as a return value
//Lambda functions are functions passed into or returned from another function

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
